Some bug fixes and new features have been added in this version of QR-Pos. The most important things are listed below:


---------------------------------------------New features
- The GUI features a more modern style
- From now on you can open the settings with one button, you don't have to start a separate program anymore.
- I added requirements.txt so you can easily install all libraries




---------------------------------------------Solved bugs
- The settings menu no longer crashes if the config file is not correct
- The notification after saving settings is no longer present, instead you can see it by the button.
- From now on you can scan qr codes in the product add tool without the camera function of the main program blocking it. It won't crash anymore.
